# UKCEH RSE Team Agreement 

_Draft - very much up for revision and renewal as the team grows! Intended as a one-page doc that every member of the team can have input into_

## Who we are

* Refer to RSE Governance outline for a "mission statement" type sentence. Briefly cover how we accept work and what criteria are used 

## Team Success

* How our programme of work lines up with objectives and strategy for UKCEH
    * FDRI implementation
    * National Capability programmes
    * Sustainable emerging technologies
    * Training and co-development for collaborative science

* How we define goals in collaboration with stakeholders (Group leaders, research collaborators)
* How we would like our work to be measured and evaluated - "what's the impact we're trying to have, and how is our progress towards that goal".
 

## Ways of Working

* Agile practises adopted from norms in EDS, to the extent possible
* At least two RSEs to each project and no more than 2 simultaneous allocations (ideallu)
* Check-ins amongst the group - how we keep one another involved in decisions when working on different things
* Visibility outside the group (research communities, internal and external to UKCEH)
* Communications norms (where documentation lives, where text chat happens)
