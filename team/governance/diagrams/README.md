# Governance diagrams

_Note: these are a draft intended to focus discussion about putting in place that "lightweight governance process" for shared workload with correct oversight.

While this note is present, the diagrams are definitely not to be read as representative of consensus reality._

A set of graphviz dotfiles intended to be read end to end. Drawn in [SketchViz](https://sketchviz.com/) where they render nicely. There's a lot of detail missing, but it's a step downwards from the high level principles.

## Diagrams

### Concept phase

Outline of the flow from a group seeking RSE contribution to a proposed project, to deciding whether it's appropriate to take forward or there are preferable routes (e.g. towards Scientific Computing or People Development).

### Triage phase

Outline of the flow from receiving a definite expression of interest through EDS Enquiries, to gauging whether a project is suitable to take forward to the committee. It's probably this phase that needs the most consideration from, and adaptation by, members of the RSE group.

### Proposal phase

Outline of the flow from receiving a proposal through a formal channel, to the committee including Science Area representatives and budget holders, to a decision about whether the group has the capacity to work on it in the timeline.
