# A new RSE group, the first 100 days

## Who we are

* A group of people with various academic and software engineering backgrounds
* MJB - Weather-gazer, occasional dancer, photographer, reader, human: https://mattjbr123.github.io/ _(I've gone for the 'who I am when I'm not working' approach to start with!)_
* JW - Mapper, hacker, choreographer, fitness instructor: https://github.com/metazool/ 
* MC - Pool player, TBD
* RL - Scout leader, TBD
* AGS - TBD
* JMR - TBD 

## Where we are 

* The "UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology"
* Not-for-profit independent Research Org.
* Focused on floods, droughts, biodiversity, pollution research
* Lots of environmental monitoring and modelling!
* Across 4 sites: Wallingford, Lancaster, Bangor, Edinburgh

## Why we're here

* Generally: To help/guide/shape good software engineering practice in an academic setting
* Specifically: Provide expertise to specific projects in the most appropriate way
* Modelling, monitoring, data science and underlying Digital Research Infrastructure
* Working on reusable components across different areas of environmental research  

## What we're aiming for

* To not be seen as a "resource" or "pool", but as humans who can help
* To make it easier for scientists to "make good decisions"/adopt good practices in projects heavily involving software/code
* To shape the future national-scale digital infrastructure UKCEH is building
* Floods and Droughts Resilience Infrastructure (find and reuse hydrological data)
* National Capability UK (share, link and reuse environmental monitoring data)

## Roles and functions

* Context of lots of RSEs or RSE-adjacents attached to groups or projects
* Flat team structure

## Culture building

* Ourselves (team agreement)
* Our collaborators (EDS, Discussions)
* Our communities ()
* Our networks (groups in parallel orgs, local interest communities)

## Outreach and skills development

* Mob programming, working with individuals
* Luxury of doing this while governance still being worked out
* SSI training conversations (they need funding allocation too)
* Clinics (ways to connect when people are heads-down; BGS example)

## Moving to the open

* "How do we communicate" - default to open?
* Handbooks, common patterns
* How many RSE groups' needs are the same

## Being welcoming

* Balance of larger and smaller commitments
* Staying aspirational while not putting people off
* Finding ways to focus on longer term plans (like workshop/clinic series)

## Thoughtful conclusion

* We have a lot more questions than we have answers
* We want to find the common ground
* Talk to us! (pictures of everyone)
