# A new RSE group, the first 100 days

## Who we are

* Background to ourselves
* A group of people with various academic and software engineering backgrounds
* MJB - Weather-gazer, occasional dancer, photographer, reader, human: https://mattjbr123.github.io/ (I've gone for the 'who I am when I'm not working' approach to start with!)

## Where we are 

* Background to UKCEH
* The "UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology": Not-for-profit independent Research Org.
* Focused on floods, droughts, biodiversity, pollution research, which involves lots of modelling and big-data analyses
* Spread across 4 offices: Wallingford, Lancaster, Bangor, Edinburgh

## Why we're here

* Aspirational vision from the governance docs
* Generally: To help/guide/shape good software engineering practice in an academic setting
* Specifically: Provide expertise to specific projects in a way tailored to the needs of each

## What we're aiming for

* A bit about banner projects like NC-UK and FDRI
* To not be seen as a "resource" or "pool", but as humans who can help
* To make it easier for scientists to "make good decisions"/adopt good practices in projects heavily involving software/code
* To develop resources, such as template repositories, and guides as part of the above bullet point, based on our experiences
* To shape the digital infrastructure being built as part of FDRI. The FDRI project aims to ease the process of finding and analysing hydrological data of clear provenance, so closely aligned with us

## Roles and functions

* Context of lots of RSEs or RSE-adjacents attached to groups or projects
* Flat team structure

## Culture building

* Ourselves (team agreement)
* Our collaborators (EDS, Discussions)
* Our communities ()
* Our networks (groups in parallel orgs, local interest communities)

## Outreach and skills development

* Mob programming, working with individuals
* Luxury of doing this while governance still being worked out
* SSI training conversations (they need funding allocation too)
* Clinics (ways to connect when people are heads-down; BGS example)

## Moving to the open

* "How do we communicate" - default to open?
* Handbooks, common patterns
* How many RSE groups' needs are the same

## Being welcoming

* Balance of larger and smaller commitments
* Staying aspirational while not putting people off
* Finding ways to focus on longer term plans (like workshop/clinic series)

## Thoughtful conclusion

* We have a lot more questions than we have answers
* We want to find the common ground
* Talk to us! (pictures of everyone)
