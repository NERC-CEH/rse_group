# UKCEH Research Software Engineering group

_Please see the new [UKCEH-RSE Organisation](https://github.com/ukceh-rse) intended to replace this repository, for our notes, discussions, talks and code projects!_

_We're still experimenting there, but plan to archive this repository._

This repository is a shared space for notes and guidance for the Research Software Engineering group at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.
