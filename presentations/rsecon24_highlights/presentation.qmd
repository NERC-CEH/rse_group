### CodeRefinery workshops

> _"We train you in research software development"_

[coderefinery.org](https://coderefinery.org) | [github.com/coderefinery](https://github.com/coderefinery) | [nordic-rse.org](https://nordic-rse.org/)

- Live-streamed workshops on twitch, similar to [the carpentries](https://carpentries.org/index.html)
- Hybrid 'bring your own classroom' format - like a 'watch party'
- Previous workshops uploaded to [youtube.com/\@coderefinery3414](https://www.youtube.com/\@coderefinery3414)
- Publically funded (by Nordic research council), run as a community project
- They seem incredibly open and seeking collaboration, see e.g. [coderefinery.org/tasks](https://coderefinery.org/tasks/)

#### For RSEs & other instructors...

- They run instructor training workshops (help us become better teachers)
- RSEs could provide workshops via their platform, so that our colleagues at other organisations can benefit

### Carbon cost of software

#### Carbon cost calculator from [green-algorithms.org](https://www.green-algorithms.org/)

- Input details of algorithm, runtime, hardware to get a CO~2~ estimate
- Inevitably _very_ large errors on estimates, particularly for HPC
- See [doi.org/10.1002/advs.202100707](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202100707) for methodology

#### A Python package [codecarbon.io](https://codecarbon.io) for _in situ_ estimates

- Speaker (from STFC) used `codecarbon` to add CO~2~ estimate to existing tool for benchmarking optimisation algorithms: [github.com/fitbenchmarking](https://github.com/fitbenchmarking/fitbenchmarking)

#### An HPC case study ([archer2.ac.uk](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/))

- Surprising claim: energy efficiency is the wrong metric as renewables increasingly dominate electricity generation. 
- Instead, aim to maximise life-span and system utilisation.
- ARCHER 2 aiming to provide emissions info to users (Jasmin could do the same!)

* * * 

### Reproducible development environments

- Speaker reported on their experience using [jetify.com/devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox), a CLT for generating dev isolated dev environments based on NixOS (see [nixos.org](https://nixos.org/))
- Just modifies `$PATH` (no virtualisation) --- very similar to `cargo`, `poetry`, `pixi` in both principle and practice
- `devbox.lock` contains everything needed to reproduce environment _exactly_

```sh
devbox init  # creates devbox.json
devbox add git  # installs git@latest & adds it to devbox.json
devbox add python@3.12  # same for Python 3.12
devbox shell  # activates the shell
```

- Nix lets you build an entire OS deterministically from a configuration file --- consistent environment on local host, CI, VM
- Unfortunately Nix does not build packages with non-free backends, so e.g. PyTorch with MKL & CUDA is difficult and tedious
- Doesn't work on Windows

### Notable mentions

#### Weather & climate RSEs - discussion

- Participants made notes during the session: [hackmd.io/W9YAQowdSSqJ2RELJEd5tw](https://hackmd.io/W9YAQowdSSqJ2RELJEd5tw)
- Join the new channel `#weather-climate` in [ukrse.slack.com](https://ukrse.slack.com/)
- Subscribe to the mailing list using the google form here: [tinyurl.com/49x7c4fc](https://tinyurl.com/49x7c4fc)
- Join the Special Interest Group using the same form

#### Framework for scaling up reproducible practices in research organisations

- Framework ([zenodo.org/records/10664660](https://zenodo.org/records/10664660)) based on a mixed-methods study [zenodo.org/records/10663903](https://zenodo.org/records/10663903) 
- Dimensions considered: tools, training, incentives, mentors, feedback, expert involvement, policies and procedures
- In most cases the interesting and difficult part is the 'scaling up' part!
- Also discussed 'good enough practices in scientific computing' --- [doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)

<!-- and suggested interventions from [bioRxiv 2022.12.08.519666](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.08.519666v1) -->


# Jo's highlights

### "Scaling reproducibility" influencing change workshop

- Discussion-focused look at the detail of [the framework](https://zenodo.org/records/10664660)
- Assess your org's maturity levels against different criteria:
- 'Locus of leadership', 'Communities of Practise', 'Tools', 'Education and training', 'Incentives', 'Modelling and mentoring', 'Review and feedback', 'Expert involvement', 'Policies and procedures'
- Helps pick where to focus effort for most payoff of impact
- Helps map a path about where to improve, without despairing where you are now
- Leaves you reflecting that the benefits of RSE work are more culture than code 

* * *

### Mutation testing - who tests the testers?

- Met Office use of [mutmut](https://mutmut.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to stress their python tests
- In essence, change the meaning of one line of code, if the tests still pass, they're weak
- Helps think twice about what your code is doing, not only how you're testing
- Useful for big legacy codebases as well as new work

* * *

### "Reproducible distributed research in practice"

- Next-level approach to distributed data-versioning and workflow tools  
- Active development by [RESIDE](https://reside-ic.github.io/) group at the MRC Centre at Imperial
- "leans on metaphors from containerisation" - best of git, docker and `{targets}`
- Language-agnostic, with a `[pyorderly](https://github.com/mrc-ide/pyorderly)` equivalent to R's `orderly`

* * *

### Special mentions!

- The [YeSTEM Equity Compass](https://yestem.org/tools/the-equity-compass/) from the opening keynote
- Early morning classes! Bhangra dancing, meditation
- Quiet Room for neurodiverse people to decompress in
- Lots of potential for more conversational, self-organising activity
