# Research Software Clinics

"Clinics" are a model used at the British Geological Survey for knowledge sharing and coaching among software engineering, data science and research staff. The sessions last an hour and run once a fortnight in the two largest BGS sites.

A typical recent session was a group of 8, 50/50 research and engineering staff.

* "Livecoding"-style introduction to a language-specific topic. Examples are different ways of string handling in python, or usage of the `pathlib` library.
* Opportunity for deep dive into more specific topics, depending on audience (in this case, what happens internally when you try to use a list as a function argument in python)
* Opportunity to ask for advice on specific issues (choice of libraries or of techniques)

The clinic sessions have other advantages beyond a knowledge sharing and occasional debugging forum:

* Onboarding experience. Recently a code-oriented geoscience research scientist co-opted the clinics for 6 sessions to run introductions to a) useful libraries b) data formats c) accessing internal data, for a group of early career researchers. 
* In-office focus. Running in-person, the clinics provide a reason for people working in different fields but with lots of common ground to synchronise in-office days
