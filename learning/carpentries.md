## Next steps

* Pathway to Instructor Training - support for making the instructor training available to every CEH developer who is interested in taking on some workshops
* Introduction to the RSE Community from the Software Sustainability Institute - arrange an invited talk (from Giacomo Peru and/or colleagues) with the new UKCEH RSE group, and other interested parties
* Run a workshop! Minimum necessary signup and environment in place to pilot a workshop at a UKCEH site, ideally in-person. Source control introduction could be a good starter workshop.
