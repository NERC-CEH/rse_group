# Research Infrastructure

Part of our remit in a group is to support the development of sustainable, reusable research infrastructure.

This could be through direct contribution to initatives like the [Floods and Droughts Research Infrastructure](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/projects/floods-and-droughts-research-infrastructure-fdri), or through work with specific research projects to develop components and configurations that related projects can re-use.

We're looking at these broad themes as part of infrastructure support:

* Data Lakes
* Pipelines
