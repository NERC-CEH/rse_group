# UKCEH RSE Group Weeknotes - 17/05/2024

(Jo) Another short weeknote contribution from me as I'm heading off to [Electromagnetic Field](https://www.emfcamp.org/) festival to discover what's happening in _" everything from blacksmithing to biometrics, chiptunes to computer security, high altitude ballooning to lockpicking, origami to democracy, and online privacy to knitting."_ 

It's wonderful to have Alba join the team last week, sharing knowledge of the UKCEH [AMI+ sensor project](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/solutions/equipment/automated-monitoring-insects-trap) that captures images and now sound of night-time insects and other nearby wildlife, and the repositories in the [AMI-system](https://github.com/AMI-system) project. I've been looking through the resources in [Sci.Vision](https://sci.vision/), a shared model catalogue for scientific computer vision projects started by the Turing Institute. It's not clear to me [how actively SciVision is sustained](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/scivision/pulls) as a research sharing project but it has some really nice elements, including its use of [Intake Catalogs](https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for data sharing. There's a lot to the Intake ecology, with potential for ease of use in many pipeline projects which look like AMI or our other "starter project" on freshwater plankton characterisation.

A benefit of working in UKCEH is the internal seminars - today's was a series of presentations by "early career" researchers (who all seemed to me to have weel developed careers and leadership roles already!). The presentation on AMI+ sparked a really interesting question - why is biodiversity research so focused on species enumeration rather than looking at broader ecosystemic effects? There is so much networked complexity, and perhaps not much consensus on methods or communication of results. It definitely feels like an exciting time to be engaging in cross-disciplinary environmental research from a data/tools/platform perspective...
