# UKCEH RSE Group Weeknotes - 10-05-2024

Handing over the weeknotes to Matt this week!

A bullet point update from Jo:

* Visiting colleagues from BGS in Edinburgh doing RSE meets DevOps work in the Informatics team there and learning about their model of "software clinics"
* Working out next steps for offering instructor training to everyone who would like it and identifying priorities and collaborators for a workshop programme https://github.com/NERC-CEH/rse_group/blob/main/learning/carpentries.md
* Getting back into R, road testing one of the CEH external courses with the upgraded R version, and also had a lovely demo from Peter Levy of workflows in `{targets}` - repeatable pipelines to generate analyses embedded in RMarkdown publication documents - also available in this Github organisation https://github.com/NERC-CEH/targets_demo
